# Palcon Quest
*Check config folder to configurate your DB*

This project include two front end screens, with an MVC design pattern backend. 
I used to code in PHP at backend side, and HTML/JS at front end side. 
I used XAMPP with Apache server and MYSQL to store my data.
I used rest api to build the code easier and faster to add functionalities. 
To add more actions just add file to actions folder, and method on the model if needed. 

# How to start the program as i did: 
1. Open xampp control panel.
2. Turn apache & mysql on.
3. Check that user named "root" has no password.
4. Open db name "test".
5. Open table name "students".
6. Add two columns: name & grade
7. Go to xampp file in you'r computer, and put the whole project ("palcon_pt-master" folder) in htdocs folder. 
8. Open the browser and enter at the url line: "127.0.0.1/palcon_pt-master/actions_page.html"

You will be able to add, delete or edit users or see the students and they'r grades in a click.
